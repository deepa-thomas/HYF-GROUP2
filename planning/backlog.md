# Backlog

## Must-Haves

are necessary for basic usability:

- As a user I want to see the menu (Home,Features,Docs) so that I can figure out easily how the website works.
  - Given the user wants to navigate to sections of the website, each page should open with the same tab.
  - Given the user wants to know where she currently is, there should be an outline around the selected button to prevent any confusion.
  - Given the user short and precise information about the current webpage.
- As a user I want a logo so that my website can be easily identified.
   
- **user story name**: As a [type of user] I want to [do something] so that [I achieve some goal]
  - Given [context] when [a specific action is performed] then [a set of consequences should occur]
  - ...
- ...

## Should-Haves

will complete the user experience, but are not necessary:

- As a user, I want the website to be mobile-friendly so that I can reach the website on mobile quickly.
  - Given the user wants to open the website on mobile, all sections(menu,form etc.) should be responsive.
  - Show the user which program languages Loruki supports.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the contact navigation bar, so that I know how to contact the company if I am interested.
  
- **user story name**: As a [type of user] I want to [do something] so that [I achieve some goal]
  - Given [context] when [a specific action is performed] then [a set of consequences should occur]



## Could-Haves

would be really cool ... if there's time:

- As a user,I want to see "Frequently Asked Questions" navbar, so that I can find information about my question.
  - Given the user wants to search for information then there should be a FAQ section added to the navbar.
- As a visitor I want social networks icons.
  - Given social network icons so that they connect Loruki through social network.

- **user story name**: As a [type of user] I want to [do something] so that [I achieve some goal]
  - Given [context] when [a specific action is performed] then [a set of consequences should occur]
  - ...
